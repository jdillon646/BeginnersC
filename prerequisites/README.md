Prerequisites - Before the fun.
=====

In this chapter, you're going to be reading into
what I would consider "prerequisite knowledge" for
beginning your journey. By the end of this chapter,
you should know:

* The origins of programming.
* The origins of C.
* What C and programming can do for you.
* How to set up a comfortable work environment.

Consider this your first step.
