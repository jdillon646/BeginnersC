A beginners guide to programming using C.
======

This book is for the absolite beginner and serves as a introduction
into the vast and magical world of computer programming. By the end
of this book you will have earned your beginners wand, which allows
you cast entry-level spells and incantations.

C is a relatively high level programming language used for its
ability to easily interact with hardware, produce fast programs
and small binaries. Due to its small size as a programming language, 
I find it to be quite a good introductory language into programming 
(though it can be tricky at times). Introduced in 1972, C has solidified 
its position of being one of the most used programming languages of all time.
